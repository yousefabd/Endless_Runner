All plants share one atlas texture. The opacity (transparency) information for "cutting out" the plants is stored in the alpha channel of the tga file.



I recommend turning off "backface culling" for all meshes, but for the plants, it is required.


The other meshes and parts of the plants (like the tree trunks) share one BaseBolor texture. You can set up the two materials with the desired roughness. Set the metalness to 0. I like to add a bit of subsurface scattering to my plant materials, too.


All the props that use the BaseColor texture are unwrapped and placed on the different colors of the said texture. If you would like more color variants, you can simply move the UV shells to another color of your liking using a 3D software like e.g. blender.

I have published other kits with a similar style. For example, you could easily combine the pond kit with this forest kit. It contains even more props and plants that you could use for your project.
